## Overview

Whisky Legends is an e-commerce website that sells an array of whiskies from all over the world, as well as a small selection of whisky related products. Users will be able to register for an account which will provide them access to their own profile where they are able to store personal and delivery information, view their order history, and view their own wishlist. Registered users will also be able to rate and review any of the whiskies/products on the site.

## User Experience

### Strategy

This website is aimed at whisky fans who would like to purchase one or multiple bottles of whisky, and/or some whisky related products.

#### Business Model

The business model for this e-commerce website is a 'B2C â€“ Business to customer' model. Non of the products sold are made or developed by Whisky legends, so everything is bought at wholesale prices in order to sell to customers at a profit. With this in mind the site has been designed to make everything as easy as possible for customers visiting the site. Everthing is designed to be easily found and understood, with the aim of producing a positive response from the site's users.

#### Marketing Strategy

The marketing strategy for this site uses a combination of Email Marketing, Social Media Marketing and Search Engine Optimisation.

Users can subscribe to the site's mailing list by submitting their email address via a simple MailChimp form in the site's footer.

A [Facebook business page](https://www.facebook.com/Whisky-Legends-113839797954063) has been created which is also linked to in the footer of the site, where users are encourged to visit and follow the page. An image of the page can be found [here](assets//readme-images/fb-full.JPG).

##### Search Engine Optimisation

To optimise how search engines will view this site, a number of short and long tail keywords are needed. After some research using Google's 'People always ask' and 'Related Searches' features, a list of 10-20 short and long tail keywords were discovered and have been placed in the keywords meta tag in the head of the main html document.

#### Epics and User Stories

### Scope

All of the user stories outlined above are feasible for the first release of the website. Some further features that could be implemented later on include:

- Providing store owners with the ability to add new brands, countires, flavours etc from the front end instead of having to do this via the Django admin panal.
- Adding a 'load more' button to the shop page to prevent the need to load all products each time the page is visited.

Having these features will not impact the user experience too much, so it is fine to exclude them for the first release.

### Structure

The structure of the website is aimed to be as simple as possible whilst showing all the necessary information. The main parts of the site will be accessible from the navbar, with any other parts easily accessible from the relevant pages. The main parts of the site included within the navbar are as follows:

- Home
- Shop
- Contact
- Cart
- Register
- Login

- Delete Product (store owners only - accessed from shop page and product detail page - confirmation modal is shown - redirects on confirmation)
- Delete Review (store owners and reviewer only - accessed from product detail page - confirmation modal is shown - redirects on confirmation)

- The checkout app handles everything to do with processing payments and interacting with stripe.
- The contact app handles the contact form.
- The home app handles the home page, 404 error page and 500 error page.
- The profiles app handles the user profile, order history and wishlist functionality and pages.

The site map can be seen in the following image:

![Site Map](assets/readme-images/site-map.png)

#### Data Models

Throughout development and deployment the same Heroku Postgres database has been used to store all necessary data for the site. 11 custom models have been created across 3 of the site's apps, Checkout, Profiles and Shop.

##### Checkout App Models

The Checkout app has 2 database models associated with it: Order and OrderLineItem.

- The Order model stores all the necessary data needed for an individual order, including order number, delivery info, date and costs etc. It also has a many to one relationship with the UserProfile model (described below in [Profiles App Models](#profiles-app-models)). The 'Original Cart' and 'Stripe PID' fields are used in conjunction with Stripe Webhooks to prevent duplicate orders from being created if the user is somehow disconnected whilst a payment is being processed.

- The OrderLineItem model stores individual line items associated with an order, including quantity and cost. It has a many to one relationship with the Order model and also has a many to one relationship with the Product model (described below in [Shop App Models](#shop-app-models)). There will be an order line item instance for each product in an order.

##### Profiles App Models

The Profiles app has 2 database models associated with it: UserProfile and Wishlist.

- The UserProfile model has a one to one relationship with Django's built-in User model, and has a variety of other fields used to store user's default name and delivery details etc.

- The Wishlist table has a one to one relationship with Django's built-in User model as well as a many to many relationship with the Product model (described below in [Shop App Models](#shop-app-models)). Each user can have an individual wishlist that can contain multiple products.

##### Shop App Models

The Shop app has 7 database models associated with it: Type, Brand, Country, Region, Flavour, Product and Review.

The Type model is used to store all available product types.

The Brand model is used to store all available product brands. It has many to one relationships with the Country and Region models.

The Country model is used to store all available countries.

The Region model is used to store all available regions.

The Flavour model is used to store all available whisky flavours.

The Product model is used store all the necessary information associated with an individual product. It has many to one relationships with the Type, Brand and Flavour models, as well as fields to store info such as name, description etc.

The Review model has many to one relationships with Django's built-in User model and with the Product model. Its other fields store review related information including rating, content and date.

##### Database Schema

Here is an image showing how all of the site's models relate to each other.

### Surface

#### Imagery

An image of old paper has been used as the background of the header, footer, modals and some menu dropdowns. This provides a somewhat old fashioned feel which helps portray the whisky related theme.

![Old Paper Image](assets/readme-images/paper-readme.JPG)

#### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of the site is very simple, with the main colours being white, a shade of red, a shade of black, and black itself with various levels of opacity. The shade of red further helps with the whisky related theme.

![Website's Colours](assets/readme-images/colour-scheme.JPG)

#### Typography

For the typography choices, [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?sort=popularity) was used, sorted by popularity to give an idea of some fonts that are likely to work well across many websites.

The ones that stood out and seemed most suited to the project were chosen. They are as follows:

Lobster - This is used for the Whisky Legends logo shown on the navbar.

Roboto Condensed - This is used for all other text throughout the site.

Lobster is of the font category 'Cursive' and Roboto Condensed is of the font category Sans Serif. The font categories will be used as a fallback if for any reason a specified font isn't available.

### Validator Testing

- __HTML__

  - Originally, a few errors were showing up when the site was put through the [W3C Markup Validation Service.](https://validator.w3.org/), but they have all since been rectified and now no errors are showing on any of the pages.

- __CSS__

  - No errors were found when put through the [W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw.](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

- __JavaScript__

  - No errors were found when put through the [JSHint.](https://jshint.com/)


- __Python__

  - All python files have been put through the [PEP8 linter](http://pep8online.com/). Any issues that were found due to long lines, trailing whitespace etc. have been rectified and no errors are now showing.

### Performance Testing

The website was audited for mobile and desktop using Google Chrome's lighthouse feature.

[WAVE Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to test the accessibility across all the pages of the site.

### Device and Browser Compatibility Testing

To test the site's compatibility across a range of devices [Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/) was used, going through all of the user stories on each device it includes in both portrait and landscape modes. The devices included are as follows:

  - iPhone X
  - Pixel 2
  - iPhone 6-8
  - iPhone 6-8 Large Version
  - iPad

Chrome Dev Tools was also used to check the site's compatibility across a range of other devices also in both portrait and landscape modes. These devices include:

  - Ipad Pro
  - Galaxy Fold (which has a very narrow viewport of only 280px in portrait mode)

Actual mobile devices belonging to family and friends were also used for testing which includes the following:

  - iPhone 7
  - Pixel 4
  - S10 Plus

A desktop monitor was also used for testing with a couple of different resolutions to check that the site remains to look and act as expected on larger screens. The resolutions were: 1366 x 768 and 1920 x 1080.

Google Chrome was the browser used for the majority of testing during the development process, but once development had neared an end some other browsers were used for testing to make sure the site had cross-browser compatibility. The full list of browsers used for testing are as follows:

  - Chrome
  - Edge
  - Firefox

### Bugs

#### Fixed Bugs

- On the 'ages' dropdown in the filtering section of shop.html the 'dictsort' function was treating the integer values as string values which meant that the order of the whisky ages was not correct in the dropdown. This was caused because some of the products did not have 'age' values and were therefore of 'None' type. This was fixed by not adding these products to the 'ages' dictionary created within the get_context_data function in views.py.

- If a product did not have a region associated with it then an error was caused in views.py when trying to add it to the regions dictionary. This was fixed by adding an if statement that only tried to add to the dictionary if a region exists for the product.

- The maximum number of any item that can be added to the cart is 99, but on the cart page if a number higher than 99 was typed into the quantity form and the 'update' button was then clicked, the form validation was not working. This was becasue the form was being submitted using AJAX and therefore skipped the HTML validation step. This was fixed by manually validating the value when the 'update' button is clicked and only submitting the form using AJAX if valid. If not valid, a 'click' event of a hidden 'submit' input field is called which triggers the HTML form validation.

- When making a payment through the checkout, if a user was not logged in, the website crashed and the payment did not go through. This was caused because the 'id-save-info' checkbox is not shown when a user is not logged in, so the javascript file came to a halt when trying to access a variable set to this element. This was fixed by checking if the variable's value was 'null' before attempting to make any further changes, and setting it to 'false' instead of 'null' if so.

- When viewing the cart or product detail pages, if a user was not logged in, and error was thrown. This was because within the assoiciated views, a UserWishlist object is assigned to a variable, which is not possible when a registered user does not exist. This was not handled correctly so an exception was thrown. This was solved by first checking if the current user is anonymous, and if so not attempting to access a UserWishlist object.

- When initially adding the 'previous_url' variable to contexts.py if there was no previous url an error was thrown. This was fixed by adding a simple if statement to check whether 'previous_url' had a value before attempting to use it.

- When adding a product via the product management page, the product was not showing up in the list of products on shop.html. This was rectified by setting the queryset within the get_queryset function in the Shop view instead of within the class definition itself.

- When deleting a product that was currenlty in a user's cart a 404 error would be thrown and would do so until the user's current session was cleared. This was due to using the get_object_or_404 when creating the cart_items dictionary within contexts.py. This was solved by using a try except block to skip any cart items that do not exist instead of the using get_object_or_404.

- When sorting by rating, products that did not have a rating were shown in the list before the highest or lowest rated products. This was because their annotated 'rating' field always had a value of None. To fix this a variable called 'rating_none' is declared, initially with a value of None, which is used when sorting in acsending order, but given a value of zero when sorting in decsending order. This forces the products with no rating to be forced to the end of the list when sorting in either direction.

#### Unfixed Bugs

- When the 'save info' checkbox is not selected when submitting a successful order on checkout.html the user's details are still saved to the profile page even though they shouldn't be.
