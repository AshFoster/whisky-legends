## Overview

## User Experience

### Strategy

#### Epics and User Stories

More detail about the user stories including acceptance criteria and tasks associated with each of them can be found in the [issues](https://github.com/AshFoster/whisky-legends/issues) section of the GitHub repository.

### Scope

### Structure

![Site Map](assets/readme-images/site-map.png)

#### Data Models

##### App Models


### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobiles, tablets, and desktops using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The actual pages do differ slightly from the original wireframes.

Here are links to each of them:

- [Desktop - Home](assets/wireframes/home-desktop.png)
- [Tablet - Home](assets/wireframes/home-tablet.png)
- [Mobile - Home](assets/wireframes/home-mobile.png)
- [Desktop - Shop](assets/wireframes/shop-desktop.png)
- [Tablet - Shop](assets/wireframes/shop-tablet.png)
- [Mobile - Shop](assets/wireframes/shop-mobile.png)

### Surface

#### Imagery

#### Colour Scheme

#### Typography

For the typography choices, [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?sort=popularity) was used, sorted by popularity to give an idea of some fonts that are likely to work well across many websites.

The ones that stood out and seemed most suited to the project were chosen. They are as follows:

Each of them is of the font category Sans Serif which is the font used as a fallback if for any reason the specified font isn't available.

## Testing

### User Stories Testing

#### Epic 1:


### Validator Testing

- __HTML__

  - Originally, a few errors were showing up when the site was put through the [W3C Markup Validation Service.](https://validator.w3.org/), but they have all since been rectified and now no errors are showing on any of the pages.

- __CSS__

  - No errors were found when put through the [W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw.](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

- __JavaScript__

  - No errors were found when put through the [JSHint.](https://jshint.com/)


- __Python__

  - All python files have been put through the [PEP8 linter](http://pep8online.com/). Any issues that were found due to long lines, trailing whitespace etc. have been rectified and no errors are now showing.

### Performance Testing

The website was audited for mobile and desktop using Google Chrome's lighthouse feature.

[WAVE Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to test the accessibility across all the pages of the site.

### Device and Browser Compatibility Testing

To test the site's compatibility across a range of devices [Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/) was used, going through all of the user stories on each device it includes in both portrait and landscape modes. The devices included are as follows:

  - iPhone X
  - Pixel 2
  - iPhone 6-8
  - iPhone 6-8 Large Version
  - iPad

Chrome Dev Tools was also used to check the site's compatibility across a range of other devices also in both portrait and landscape modes. These devices include:

  - Ipad Pro
  - Galaxy Fold (which has a very narrow viewport of only 280px in portrait mode)

Actual mobile devices belonging to family and friends were also used for testing which includes the following:

  - iPhone 7
  - Pixel 4
  - S10 Plus

A desktop monitor was also used for testing with a couple of different resolutions to check that the site remains to look and act as expected on larger screens. The resolutions were: 1366 x 768 and 1920 x 1080.

Google Chrome was the browser used for the majority of testing during the development process, but once development had neared an end some other browsers were used for testing to make sure the site had cross-browser compatibility. The full list of browsers used for testing are as follows:

  - Chrome
  - Edge
  - Firefox
